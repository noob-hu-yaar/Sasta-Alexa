As the name suggests, this is a very small scale replica type model of Alexa, which I've tried to make using Python language (and some of its libraries like pyttsx3, PyAudio etc.)

I have uploaded some basic functionalities like- 
* It opens Google for me
* It opens YouTube for me
* It opens CodeForces for me

It can also be made to open similar other websites by writing some simple lines of code.
It can also perform some other activities like 
* Opening up my c++ coding template, which I often use for programming
* Telling the exact time, upon asking.
* Opening wikipedia, as well as reading two sentences about the topic asked to search.

This is quite a simple to code model, but is a really useful and handy one.
It can further be made to perform more activities like-
* Opening Music from the Desktop.
* Opening other relevant websites.
* Sending Email from one to another account.
* And many other applications.

One feature that I've included is that the assistant greets me Good Morning,Good Afternoon or so, on the basis of the time it is operated.
for example- if I run it at 7:00pm, it greets me with a Good Evening.

I hereby attach two videos of the working model-

NB: I have used Spyder IDE to write the code. Anyone willing to use the code can download my repo and run it on any suitable IDE (after downloading a few python packages.)

NB2: As I'm not a professional and quite a newbie, any positive suggestions are welcome : )
